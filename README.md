# Project - Music Recommender
## Marko Znamenacek


### In this project I am aiming to build a simple music recommendation system that would look something like this: User enters name of song (or perhaps even artist) and AI goes trough some Spotify database and looks for similar characteristics (beats per minute, vocals yes/no, genre, author, year, etc.) and gives out a list of 10 results.
