# Project - Music Recommender
## Marko Znamenacek

### Project goal
#### In this project I am aiming to build a simple music recommendation system that would look something like this: User enters name of song (or perhaps even artist), and AI goes trough some Spotify database looking for similar characteristics (beats per minute, vocals yes/no, genre, author, year, etc.), and gives out a list of 5 or more results.

### Dataset
